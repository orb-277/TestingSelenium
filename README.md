# TestingSelenium
Created a testing Script for the link: https://app.cloudqa.io/home/AutomationPracticeForm<br>
Changing the XPath of the element in page.py and switching to the correct frame allows us to access the Iframe forms.

<h3> Few problems with the Form: </h3>
<ol>
  <li>Date of Birth does not accept dates after the year 2000</li>
  <li>Password and Confirm Password are not checked</li>
  <li>Mobile Number Lenght is not checked</li>
  <li>Username and Password are not mandatory</li>
  <li>State should not give a dropdown list of countries</li>
</ol>
